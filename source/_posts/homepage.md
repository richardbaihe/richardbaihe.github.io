# About

I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), primarily working on natural language processing and large model pretraining.

I received my PhD degree from the University of Waterloo, worked on language modeling and unsupervised machine learning under the supervision of [Ming Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=oGgPXFEAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Before that, I worked with [Chengqing Zong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=l8lvKOQAAAAJ&hl=en) on spoken language understanding.

I have served as a PC member of ACL (2020-2024), EMNLP (2019-2023), ICML (2022-2023), Neurips (2023), ICLR (2023-2024), AAAI (2020), COLING (2020-2024). I received ICML Outstanding Reviewers awards (2022). I am an organizer of Embodied AI Workshop in CVPR 2024.

My recent research focuses on below topics:
- Long-form sequence modeling
- LLM Factualness and Evaluation
- Multilingual NLP

<!-- 
My past works concern modeling text and speech sequences to achieve lower perplexity, better generation, and benefit downstream language tasks; specifically, we address the problem of modeling text and text-speech sequences with Transformer-based language models. My favorite works during my Ph.D. study are [Segment-Aware Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14996), [Hypernym-Instructed Language Modeling](arxiv.org/abs/2203.10692), and [Alignment-Aware Acoustic and Text Modeling](arxiv.org/abs/2203.09690).  -->
